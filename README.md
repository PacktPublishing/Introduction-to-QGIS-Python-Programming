# Introduction to QGIS Python Programming [Video]
This is the code repository for [Introduction to QGIS Python Programming [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/introduction-qgis-python-programming-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
##  QGIS is a standalone geographical information system -- that is, an application for viewing, analyzing and editing geospatial data. This video course shows how to leverage QGIS as a tool for developing geospatial applications using Python. Geospatial applications are often very complicated; using QGIS, you can avoid a lot of this complexity by developing at a higher level, making use of many of the tools for viewing, analyzing and editing geospatial data that are provided by the QGIS system. Using these tools, you can build more sophisticated geospatial applications with less time and effort.
After completing this course, you will be able to solve real-world data mining problems.
